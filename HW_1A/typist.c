/*
With this program, user type texts line by line, where each line has a maximum length of 127 characters.  
Each line is considered as "entered" (i.e., finalized) when the ENTER or RETURN key is clicked.
The program counts the number of characters entered for each minute.
When user types ":exit", the program exits.  
The Makefile should be changed to include this program and thus it can be run from the shell of xv6.
