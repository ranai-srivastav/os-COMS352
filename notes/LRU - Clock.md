There are two parts to this algorithm, the clock algorithm and the search part.

At each step we search through. The searching process can only change bits to 1 but not to 0. The searching process cycles through all the elements once and can start anywhere, it wouldn;t matter (because it can't change things to 0). If a page we are looking for is found, we set it's bit to 1. If we don't find it we move on to the next entry.

Once the search step is over, if we need replacement then we move to the clock algorithm (which is a replacement algorithm). We start where the pointer was last. The pointer starts at the very left at the begining of the algorithm. It then cycles through and turns bits to 0 if they are 1 (giving them a second chance) and moves the pointer ahead by 1. If it finds a bit whose value is 0, it changes that and moves the pointer ahead by 1 so that we don't consider the thing we added again.
